# ROBOT CAN HELP
### Collaborative Robot System
## Technical Introduction
* Utilizing OpenCV image processing to enhance processing speed.
* Employing YOLOv4 for AI object detection.
* Employing MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition.
* Controlling robotic arm in real-time via servo mechanisms.
* Creating user-friendly interface using PyQt5 for easier operation.
* Using reinforcement learning to enable the robot to autonomously plan its movement trajectory.

## Proposal Scenario

## Practical Application Scenarios
* For instance, in the factory collaboration between KUKA and BMW:
The robotic arm handles heavier gear components.
Humans are responsible for placing fasteners and bearings.
* There was an unfortunate incident where a chess-playing robot broke a child's finger. There is also a possibility of such accidents occurring during collaboration. If we could implement real-time adjustments to movement through vision, we could prevent such accidents.
